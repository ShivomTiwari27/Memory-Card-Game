# Memory Card Game

## Overview
This project is a simple memory card game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it challenges users to match all pairs of cards within a limited time.

### The challenge
The goal is to match all pairs of cards before the timer runs out. Players have a limited number of flips, and the game tracks both the time and the number of flips used.

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript for game logic
- Flexbox for layout

### What I learned
Working on this project helped reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. I also learned how to manage game states and improve user interaction with animations.

### Continued development
I plan to enhance the game by adding difficulty levels, implementing a scoring system based on time and flips, and making it responsive for different screen sizes.

### Useful resources
- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me understand and apply Flexbox for layout.
- [JavaScript.info - Event Delegation](https://javascript.info/event-delegation) - This resource was useful for managing events in the game efficiently.
